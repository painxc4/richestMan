        <h2>Q: Nicholas, tell us about your first big break.</h2>
        <p><strong>Nicholas T:</strong> "Believe it or not, it all started with a small lakeside property I bought in my 20s. Everyone thought I was crazy to invest in land that nobody wanted. But I saw potential — and that potential turned into a luxury resort within 10 years."</p>
        
        <h2>Q: What motivates you to keep going, even after achieving so much?</h2>
        <p><strong>Nicholas T:</strong> "Success isn't a destination; it's a responsibility. I’m driven by the impact I can create — whether it’s through new business ventures or giving back to the community here in Duluth. The city gave me a chance, and I’ll always pay it forward."</p>
        
        <h2>Q: Any advice for aspiring entrepreneurs?</h2>
        <p><strong>Nicholas T:</strong> "Never underestimate the power of vision. Everyone focuses on quick wins, but true wealth — in any sense — comes from playing the long game. Be patient, stay curious, and never stop learning."</p>
